# Postfix Expression Calculator

This repository contains a Java implementation of a Postfix Expression Calculator. Postfix notation, also known as Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), is a mathematical notation in which every operator follows all of its operands. For example, the infix expression "2 + 3" is represented as "2 3 +" in postfix notation. The calculator evaluates postfix expressions and returns the calculated result.
